## Getting Started

Code is written in a range of languages. Fork the repositories and give them a try.

## Usage

Usage is free to modify. If you use the code for a journal publication, please cite the associated journal or at the very least give us an acknowledgement in the article.

## Deployment

A lot of the code was written for High Performance Computer deployment. Therefore, will work best right out of the box in Linux. This is a mute for more recent python codes that use Jupiter notebooks.
